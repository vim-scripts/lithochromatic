Lithochromatic is a theme that aims better readabilty. It uses a small color
set.

A screenshot is available at http://gkayaalp.com/img/lithochromatic-1.1-gnome-terminal.png .

One of main concerns is to be consistent in highlighting, which means
using same or related colors for related elements of source code. This makes
maintaining concentration while editing and reading easier.

Recently I have changed whole color set of LithoChromatic from a less
consistent set to a better one. I have also set colors for gvim this time.
